# Project Progress

## Overall Status
We are implementing the three-component H.Airbrush architecture:
1. **Inkscape Extension** (95% complete)
2. **Web Controller** (5% complete)
3. **Duet 2 WiFi Integration** (15% complete)

Current focus is on ensuring reliable G-code generation. We recently fixed an issue where the G-code output contained only comments and no movement commands by reverting the path batching system while keeping other improvements.

## Completed Work

### Inkscape Extension Component
- [x] Redesigned extension structure based on AxiDraw model
- [x] Created `hairbrush.inx` and `hairbrush_control.py` entry points
- [x] Implemented core modules for SVG parsing and path processing
- [x] Created installation script for Windows compatibility
- [x] Added error handling and logging
- [x] Fixed critical issue with G-code generation (no movement commands)
- [x] Simplified G-code output with cleaner formatting
- [x] Fixed slanted drawing issues with proper X-Y plane alignment
- [x] Enhanced G-code generator with physics-based airbrush parameters

### Architecture Planning
- [x] Defined three-component system architecture
- [x] Created communication flow diagrams
- [x] Established data models for G-code and configuration
- [x] Documented component responsibilities

## In Progress
- [ ] Creating a GitHub repository for the project
- [ ] Creating example SVG files for testing
- [ ] Researching Duet 2 WiFi G-code command structure
- [ ] Planning Web Controller implementation

## Next Steps
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the working code
2. Update user guide with latest changes
3. Begin Web Controller implementation
4. Implement G-code streaming via Telnet

## Component Status
- **Inkscape Extension**: 95% complete
  - SVG parsing and path processing implemented
  - G-code generation working properly with movement commands
  - Fixed critical issue with G-code generation
  - Simplified G-code output for better readability
  
- **Web Controller**: 5% complete
  - Architecture defined
  - Component structure planned
  
- **Duet Integration**: 15% complete
  - Communication protocols defined
  - Basic G-code command structure researched
  - Z-axis performance considerations documented

## Technical Challenges
- Z-axis moves 20x slower than X/Y axes (requires consideration in path planning)
- Path distortion in G-code output (fixed)
- Coordinate system transformation issues (fixed)
- Bezier curve approximation accuracy
