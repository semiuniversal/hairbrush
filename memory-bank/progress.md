# Project Progress

## Overall Status
We have made significant progress in setting up the development environment, researching key technologies, and implementing the foundational components of the hairbrush project. Currently, we are in Stage 1 (Environment Setup and Research) and Stage 4 (Inkscape Extension Development) of our implementation plan.

## Completed Work

### Environment Setup
- Set up WSL development environment with Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
- Configured Python environment with uv for virtual environment management
- Created pyproject.toml with minimal dependencies (lxml, PyYAML)
- Initialized git repository and created .gitignore file
- Set up project directory structure

### Research
- Completed research on Inkscape extension development
- Studied AxiDraw extension as a reference implementation
- Documented findings in research_notes.md
- Investigated extension installation approaches across platforms

### Core Library Development
- Created basic project structure with src/hairbrush package
- Implemented SVG parsing module for extracting paths from layers
- Created G-code generator class for converting paths to G-code
- Implemented configuration module for loading YAML settings

### Inkscape Extension Development
- Created dual_airbrush_export.inx with UI definition
- Implemented dual_airbrush_export.py with core functionality
- Added layer selection and export options
- Connected extension to core library
- Created installation tools for the extension
- Documented installation process for cross-platform compatibility

## In Progress
- Researching Duet 2 WiFi G-code command structure
- Preparing to create test SVG files for validation
- Planning advanced path processing features

## Next Steps
1. Research Duet 2 WiFi G-code command structure
2. Create test SVG files for validating the extension functionality
3. Test the extension installation process on different platforms
4. Make initial git commit to preserve current progress
5. Implement advanced path processing features in the G-code generation engine

## Timeline Update
- **Stage 1**: Environment Setup and Research - 90% complete
- **Stage 2**: Core Library Development - 75% complete
- **Stage 3**: G-code Generation Engine - 20% complete
- **Stage 4**: Inkscape Extension Development - 80% complete
- **Stage 5**: Integration and Testing - 0% complete
- **Stage 6**: Refinement and User Feedback - 0% complete
- **Stage 7**: Phase 2 Planning - 0% complete

## Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented the basic structure of the Inkscape extension
- Created a modular architecture that separates concerns between SVG parsing and G-code generation
- Developed installation tools for easy deployment across platforms
- Established a minimalist dependency approach to keep the project lean

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Handling the inkex dependency which is provided by Inkscape
  - **Solution**: Used a dynamic import approach similar to AxiDraw, with proper error handling
- **Challenge**: Creating a cross-platform installation process
  - **Solution**: Developed installation scripts that detect the OS and install to the appropriate location
- **Challenge**: Managing dependencies efficiently
  - **Solution**: Adopted a minimalist approach, adding dependencies only when concretely needed

## Lessons Learned
- Studying existing implementations like AxiDraw provides valuable insights into best practices
- A modular architecture makes the system more maintainable and extensible
- Keeping dependencies minimal reduces potential conflicts and simplifies installation

## Notes
- The project is on track according to the implementation plan
- We're prioritizing a working implementation over premature optimization
- The extension architecture is designed to be extensible for future enhancements

## Known Issues
- None identified yet

## Implementation Details
- The system will be implemented in Python for cross-platform compatibility
- Inkscape extension will use the `inkex` library
- Command templates will use YAML for configuration
- The initial implementation will focus on Duet 2 WiFi compatibility
- The system is designed with modularity to support future hardware options
