## Implementation Details

### Web Controller Architecture
The web controller follows a modular architecture:
- Flask web server with SocketIO for real-time communication
- DuetClient class for HTTP API communication with the Duet board
- JobManager class for G-code file handling
- MachineControl class for machine control operations
- Responsive web UI with Bootstrap

### Duet Communication
The Duet communication uses the HTTP API:
- Send G-code commands via HTTP GET requests to `/rr_gcode`
- Get responses via HTTP GET requests to `/rr_reply`
- Query status via HTTP GET requests to `/rr_status`
- Use M400 commands for motion synchronization
- Use M114 commands for position monitoring
- Use M119 commands for endstop monitoring

### Machine Control Interface
The machine control interface provides:
- Jog controls for X, Y, and Z axes
- Home buttons for all axes, XY, and Z
- Brush control buttons for air and paint
- Manual command input
- Position visualization
- Position display
- Endstop status monitoring
- Movement distance and speed controls

- Use uv for virtual environment management
- Use pyproject.toml for dependency management
- Follow minimalist approach to dependencies
