# Project Progress

## Overall Status
We are implementing the three-component H.Airbrush architecture:
1. **Inkscape Extension** (95% complete)
2. **Web Controller** (95% complete)
3. **Duet 2 WiFi Integration** (20% complete)

Current focus is on integrating the refactored JavaScript modules into the main application and testing with real hardware.

## Recent Improvements

### JavaScript Architecture Refactoring Status (July 12, 2025)
- Completed development of core modules and components:
  - Implemented machine-state.js for centralized state management
  - Implemented command-engine.js for hardware command abstraction
  - Implemented websocket-client.js for standardized communication
  - Implemented error-handler.js for standardized error handling
  - Implemented UI components (brush-control.js, movement-control.js, visualization.js)
- Implemented comprehensive JavaScript testing framework with Vitest:
  - Achieved ~84% test coverage for core modules
  - Achieved ~100% test coverage for UI components
- Removed standalone HTML test files in favor of automated testing
- Identified integration challenges:
  - Main application (control.js) still uses old architecture
  - No imports of new modules in main application files
  - Need to create app.js as main entry point

### JavaScript Testing Framework Implementation (July 10, 2024)
- Set up Vitest with JSDOM for browser environment simulation
- Created test files for core modules and components
- Added test coverage reporting with @vitest/coverage-v8
- Created utils.js module with common utility functions
- Implemented DOM element mocking for UI component testing
- Created integration tests for component interactions
- Updated package.json with additional test commands
- Added detailed documentation in README.md

### JavaScript Architecture Modules (July 9, 2024)
- MachineState Module:
  - Created a singleton MachineState class with observable pattern
  - Implemented methods for getting and updating machine state
  - Added validation for all state changes
  - Created an event-based subscription system for state changes
  - Added support for filtered listeners to monitor specific state changes
  - Implemented batch updates for efficient state synchronization
  - Created comprehensive error handling for state operations
- CommandEngine Module:
  - Created a CommandEngine class that abstracts hardware commands
  - Implemented high-level methods for movement, brush control, and motor operations
  - Added command validation and proper error handling
  - Integrated with MachineState for state updates after command execution
  - Implemented servo angle calculation for paint flow control
  - Added command queue tracking for pending commands
- WebSocketClient Module:
  - Implemented a WebSocketClient class with robust connection management
  - Added automatic reconnection with configurable retry parameters
  - Created message queuing for offline scenarios
  - Implemented standardized message format and error handling
  - Added event-based communication system for WebSocket events
  - Integrated with MachineState for state updates from server
  - Added support for different message types (commands, events)
  - Implemented timeout handling for requests

### Setup Page Improvements (June 30, 2024)
- Fixed USB serial connection for device discovery
- Added reliable IP address detection via serial communication
- Implemented background thread for capturing IP address from serial data
- Added hierarchical diagnostic command menu with commands from YAML file
- Fixed connection history management and persistence
- Added automatic disconnection when leaving or reloading the page
- Improved error handling for serial communication

## Component Status
- **Inkscape Extension**: 95% complete
  - SVG parsing and G-code generation working properly
  - Fixed critical issues with output formatting
  
- **Web Controller**: 95% complete
  - Core functionality implemented
  - Canvas visualization working with proper scaling
  - Settings persistence implemented
  - Setup page with IP discovery working
  - JavaScript architecture refactoring partially complete
  - JavaScript testing framework implemented
  - Integration of refactored modules pending
  
- **Duet Integration**: 20% complete
  - Communication protocols defined
  - Basic G-code command structure implemented
  - Hardware testing needed

## Technical Challenges
- Windows/WSL environment issues affecting serial port access
- Integration of refactored JavaScript modules into main application
- Z-axis moves 20x slower than X/Y axes (requires optimization)
- Real-time control performance optimization
- Error recovery for hardware communication issues

## Working Features
- **Inkscape Extension**: SVG parsing, G-code generation with M400 sync points
- **Web Controller**: HTTP API communication, machine control, file management, status monitoring, endstop monitoring, canvas visualization, settings persistence, setup page with IP discovery
- **Duet Integration**: HTTP API communication, position monitoring, endstop monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Create app.js as main application entry point
2. Integrate refactored modules into main application
3. Test with real hardware
4. Create comprehensive documentation
5. Prepare for GitHub repository setup and public release

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS ⚠️
- All command-line operations MUST be executed in WSL, NOT in Windows
- Use uv for virtual environment management
- Use pyproject.toml for dependency management
- Follow minimalist approach to dependencies
