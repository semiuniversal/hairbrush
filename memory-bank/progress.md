## Implementation Details

### Web Controller Architecture
The web controller follows a modular architecture:
- Flask web server with SocketIO for real-time communication
- DuetClient class for HTTP API communication with the Duet board
- JobManager class for G-code file handling
- MachineControl class for machine control operations
- Responsive web UI with Bootstrap

### Duet Communication
The Duet communication uses the HTTP API:
- Send G-code commands via HTTP GET requests to `/rr_gcode`
- Get responses via HTTP GET requests to `/rr_reply`
- Query status via HTTP GET requests to `/rr_status`
- Use M400 commands for motion synchronization
- Use M114 commands for position monitoring
- Use M119 commands for endstop monitoring

### Machine Control Interface
The machine control interface provides:
- Jog controls for X, Y, and Z axes
- Home buttons for all axes, XY, and Z
- Brush control buttons for air and paint
- Motor control buttons (Enable/Disable toggle)
- Manual command input
- Position visualization
- Position display
- Endstop status monitoring
- Movement distance and speed controls

## Recent Accomplishments

### Motion Synchronization Implementation
We've successfully implemented the hybrid approach for motion synchronization:

1. **G-code Generation**:
   - Updated the G-code generator to insert M400 commands at strategic points
   - Added synchronization points after Z movements, XY positioning, and complete strokes
   - Ensured proper commenting of M400 commands for clarity

2. **Controller Implementation**:
   - Enhanced duet_client.py with send_command_and_wait and wait_for_motion_complete methods
   - Implemented get_position method using M114 for position tracking
   - Added G-code file processing with M400 awareness in machine_control.py

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated implementation plan to reflect the hybrid approach
   - Documented the synchronization strategy in techContext.md
   - Updated task tracking to reflect completed items

3. Perform integration testing with real hardware
4. Prepare for GitHub repository setup and public release

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS ⚠️
- All command-line operations MUST be executed in WSL, NOT in Windows
- Use uv for virtual environment management
- Use pyproject.toml for dependency management
- Follow minimalist approach to dependencies
