# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Artists who work with vector graphics need a way to translate their digital designs into physical paintings using airbrushes, without having to learn complex G-code or machine control systems. Current solutions either require technical expertise or don't provide the precision and control needed for artistic expression.

## Target Users
- Digital artists who work with vector graphics
- Makers and hobbyists interested in custom plotting hardware
- Artists looking to expand their medium to include precision airbrush work
- Potential commercial users in specialized painting applications

## User Stories
1. As a digital artist, I want to export my Inkscape designs directly to the plotter so that I can create physical versions of my work without learning G-code.
2. As a maker, I want to control my dual-airbrush plotter with intuitive commands so that I can focus on the creative process rather than technical details.
3. As an artist experimenting with new mediums, I want to adjust brush parameters easily so that I can achieve different artistic effects.
4. As a power user, I want access to advanced configuration options so that I can optimize the system for specific projects.

## Value Proposition
This system bridges the gap between digital vector art and physical airbrush painting by providing an intuitive workflow that abstracts away technical complexities. It enables artists to create high-precision, expressive paintings using black and white ink channels without requiring deep technical knowledge of G-code or machine control.

## Market Context
While there are existing plotting solutions and CNC controllers, few are specifically designed for artistic airbrush applications with a focus on user experience. This project fills a niche between industrial CNC controllers (which are complex) and simple plotters (which lack the precision and control needed for airbrush work).
